# [Project 3: Give Me Some Credit üè¶](https://github.com/YaoSheng-Yu/Give-Me-Some-Credit---predicting-due-delinquency)

- Handling missing 'Monthly Income' data by segmenting into two age groups and employing **RandomForestRegressor** for imputation.
- Checking data correlation, removing features with high **multicollinearity** to ensure model robustness.
- Using Grid Search coupled with **ROC_AUC** metric to rigorously evaluate and optimize four distinct classifiers.
- Addressing class imbalance through **under-sampling** techniques, ensuring a balanced target distribution for enhanced predictive accuracy.
